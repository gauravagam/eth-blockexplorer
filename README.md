# Ethereum Block Explorer

I have done this project as part of my alchemy ethereum blockchain course. This is very simple and basic block explorer.
In this project I have added following pages
* Home Page on which I am displaying latest 5 blocks and transactions
* all block page on which I am displaying 10 blocks on each page of pagination with few details
* Block details page on which I am displaying more details of block
* Transaction details page on which I am displaying more details of transaction
